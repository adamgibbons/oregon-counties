Put Fish Back in the Rivers and Protect Watersheds Where Fish Live\r\n\r\nCRITFC provides our four member tribes and the region with invaluable biological research, fisheries management, hydrology, and other science to support the protection and restoration of Columbia River Basin salmon, lamprey, and sturgeon. The vision of this goal is to reverse the decline of salmon, lamprey, and sturgeon and rebuild their numbers to full productivity. This work is guided by the holistic principles outlined in Wy-Kan-Ush-Mi Wa-Kish-Wit (Spirit of the Salmon), the tribal salmon plan that addresses recommended restoration actions in every phase of the salmon’s lifecycle from stream to ocean and back.\r\n\r\n2. Protect Tribal Treaty Fishing Rights\r\n\r\nCRITFC employs lawyers, policy analysts, and fisheries enforcement officers who work to ensure that tribal treaty rights are protected. All of these activities are done in careful coordination with and under the direction of member tribes. The commission works closely with state and federal agencies to ensure fair harvest sharing between tribal and non-tribal fisheries.\r\n\r\n3. Share Salmon Culture\r\n\r\nCRITFC shares news, information, and the tribal perspective on a variety of issues. Common topics include salmon and lamprey restoration, the nature of treaty fishing rights, and tribal culture. This effort ranges from school children to policy makers. By educating the general public on these topics, the tribes hope to increase interest for productive partnerships and support in the effort to restore Columbia River Basin salmon and lamprey.\r\n\r\n4. Provide Fisher Services\r\n\r\nCRITFC provides a variety of services directly to fishers from its member tribes. The Salmon Marketing program provides fishers from the four member tribes with resources to help them carry on the tradition of making a living from fishing, whether that be from commercial, over-the-bank, or value-added fish sales. The organization also operates and maintains 31 fishing access sites along the Columbia River for the exclusive or near-exclusive use of the fishers from all the member tribes."

Provide an incubator-like environment that provides a continuum of support services to assist these businesses in becoming more viable and competitive;\r\n3.

UCAN serves as a backbone for the human service system in our two county region, providing a wide array of services under its umbrella, including: early childhood education, family strengthening through case management and parent education; early childhood developmental and health screening and healthcare; food and nutrition education to families participating in early childhood programming; housing related services including affordable housing, rental, utility and move-in assistance, mortgage assistance, energy assistance and weatherization, and supportive services for residents of affordable housing projects; transportation assistance, including public transit, medicaid transportation and transportation for Head Start/Early Head Start families; health insurance enrollment support and education; food systems, including emergency food provision to pantries and kitchens, operation of pantries, and operation of a community garden; national service programming, including operation of AmeriCorps, Senior Companions, Retired Seniors Volunteer Program, and Foster Grandparents. UCAN has a \"no wrong door\" approach to service delivery, ensuring that a person who seeks services is linked with the appropriate program or agency providing the service in the community. Our co-located, comprehensive service system reflects best practices in providing services, and allows us to minimize the percentage of funds needed for administrative costs. UCAN provides services to approximately one-third of those living in Douglas and Josephine counties."

BEF made its first watershed restoration grant in 1999, and we continue to make grants and provide intensive community support each year in an effort to reinforce scientific, collaborative, and community-based watershed restoration initiatives.

    "Org Mission Statement": "The Deschutes River Conservancy (DRC) was founded with the goal of bringing together a diverse group of key stakeholders to proactively devise solutions to restore the Deschutes River Basin.  The organization was formed in response to the growing need for consensus around issues related to water quality and quantity.  In 1996, representatives from Environmental Defense, local irrigation districts and the Confederated Tribes of Warms Springs came together and founded the DRC - the first non-profit corporation to bring together State, Federal, Tribal and local government representatives as well as private stakeholders to carry out comprehensive, basin-wide ecosystem restoration.  The DRC's mission is to restore stream flow and improve water quality throughout the Deschutes Basin.\r\n\r\nThe DRC restores stream flow through a combination of temporary and permanant solutions.  A temporary streamflow restoration tool, the DRC's Annual Water Leasing Program (AWLP), has grown from a small, donation-based campaign to an eight-district, paid program comprising the largest portion of protected water in the Deschutes River.  In 2005, the leasing program delivered the largest amount of ecologically significant flows to the Deschutes Basin.  AWLP was responsible for more than doubling the average summer flow in the Middle Deschutes, contributing 89 cubic feet per second (CFS) instream.  The Annual Water Leasing Program allows holders of water rights to lease their unused water rights instream on a temporary basis.  This market-based approach provides benefits to all who participate in the program, and is indicative of the DRC's innovative, collaborative approach to conservation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the AWLP, the DRC works, in collaboration with local municipalities and irrigation districts, to devise and implement engineering-based approaches to conservation such as replacing or lining leaky irrigation canals and lateral diversions.  These projects are designed to address the fact that 50% of all water diverted from instream flow for irrigation purposes is lost as a result of seepage from irrigation ditches and canals.  By repairing and/or replacing leaky conduits, the DRC and its partners can conserve water that would otherwise be lost, which can then be diverted instream or held in reserve for other uses."

We are a full service organization with programs designed to address the mutliple issues affecting the river today, through collaboration, education, science-based approaches, and sound monitoring."

The library offers 17,500 storytimes and culturally rich family programs, and year-round literacy programs beginning at birth and continuing through high school. The library’s book collections reflect our community’s linguistic, cultural, gender and ability diversity and its website is fully available in five languages. Public funding cannot meet the growing need for programs for children and families who face disparity. Gifts to The Library Foundation, a lean, nimble nonprofit, help the library extend its reach and impact to close the opportunity gap for children who are at risk of low literacy. Last year, foundation supporters helped librarians reach 220,000 children and parents with books and programs that changed lives.  The foundation does not raise funds for library operations. We work with librarians to determine where private support can extend the library’s reach to make a transformative difference for children and families."

The Charitable Institute serves as an umbrella organization and provides administrative and human resource services for other nonprofits that align with the Alliance mission of ensuring economic prosperity in the Portland region. Sometimes these small organizations grow to the point where they can become a stand-alone nonprofit. The Charitable Institute carries out charitable research and educational pursuits."

In 2018, we will open our fourth exhibition with the Oregon Historical Society, Racing to Change: Oregon’s Civil Rights Years. Our first exhibit, Perseverance (2011), told the story of black history throughout Oregon. All Aboard! Railroading and Portland's Black Community (2013) showed how opportunities with the railroad brought black workers to Portland. A Community on the Move (2015) interpreted the history of African Americans in Portland in the 1940s and 1950s."

    "Org Mission Statement": "Founded in Lane County in 1976, the mission of the Relief Nrusery is to prevent child abuse and neglect by delivering comprehensive early intervention and family preservation services.  Prevention and strengthening families are core philosophies promoting children's healthy physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development.  Our core programs are:\r\n1- Therapeutic Early Childhood Program (TECP):   Site-based program for children aged from birth to six years, providing twice weekly classroom sessions in a developmentally appropriate early childhood environment, mental health assessments and counseling, special education assessments and services, home visits, parenting education and support, and family advocacy.\r\n2- Home Base:  Intensive home visiting version of the TECP, designed for rural or otherwise isolated families.  Provides one home visit and one site-based TECP classday each week, as well as all other services described above. \r\n3- Families Together:  An intensive parent training program for parents who have lost their children to foster care or are at risk of doing so.  Provides weekly interactive parent/child labs and parent training classes, mental health assessments and counseling referrals, special education assessments and referrals, home visits, counseling referrals, and family advocacy.\r\n4- Accessing Success:  Family-centered substance abuse recovery support program, integrated with all other programs.  Provides drug and alcohol assessment, counseling, anger management classes, peer support, childcare, transportation, and social skill activities to help parents achieve and maintain recovery.\r\n5- Outreach Connection:  For families requiring immediate intervention, or on our waiting list to enter other programs. Provides individualized, immediate-response crisis intervention, home visits, respite, developmental screenings, safety monitoring, parent training, and referrals.\r\n6- Healthy Start:  Collaboration between Relief Nursery and Healthy Start of Lane County.  Provides Nursery services, parenting education, and support to highest-risk first-birth parents; families are referred to the program, and services begin, before the birth of the child.\r\n7- Community Safety Net:   Collaboration with DHS Child Welfare  and other community agencies, designed to reach families with reports of suspected abuse or neglect made to DHS, but in which the level of abuse/neglect has not reached sufficient levels to trigger a full-scale DHS investigation.  Catches children who might otherwise \"fall through the cracks\" of conventional child protective services.\r\n\r\nFamilies we serve are among the highest risk:  all have at least 5 major risk factors correlated with child abuse and neglect, and 55% have ten or more of these risk factors.  Our population's most common risks are:  extreme low income (100%); poverty and unemployment (70-80%); high stress (65%);  substance abuse (55-70%); single parent household (50%); domestic violence (46%); history with Child Protective Services (45-60%);  and involvement with the criminal justice system (40%).  Other serious risk factors (affecting 25-35% of our population) include:  adult survivor of child abuse; battered spouse; limited education; child foster care history; mental illness; teen parent; and lack of basic support services (housing; transportation; telephone, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe Relief Nursery has a highly successful 30-year record of  working with these severely-challenged families.  After one year of Relief Nursery services fewer than 7% of  the children require further reports of child abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to DHS (our staff are mandatory reporters).  Fewer than 1% of our children need to be placed in foster care, and 100% of our children are either making appropriate developmental progress or are receiving appropriate special needs services.\r\n\r\nThis record of success has inspired many other communities in Oregon to request Relief Nurseries for their communities, and we have formal replication sites in Cottage Grove; Salem'; Portland (2 sites); Roseburg; Bend; and Albany.  Other communites are currently exploring the replication process as well, and we have received national and even international recognition for our program model.\r\n\r\nIn the past fiscal year we served 603 families in site- and home-based therapeutic programs, 147 families through our community outreach program, and an additional 194 families via the Reliefmobile -- a total of 1075 children.  Our minority population is high -- about 22%, with Hispanic families making up the largest subgroup.  For the past several years we have been providing bilingual and bicultural services in all programs, and have initiated special ESL/parenting groups for interested families.  \r\n\r\nThe Relief Nursery has been named \"an innovative program of noteworthy aspects\" by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Child Abuse and Neglect, in their 2002 national Emerging Practices in the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect project."

Over the last decade, SNW has developed positive, proactive solutions to the environmental and economic conditions that damage natural ecosystems, and destabilize rural communities.  This work involves collaborative, locally based initiatives that bridge the divide between community and environmental interests and use natural resource restoration and stewardship as an engine for rural economic development.\r\n\r\nWe achieve our mission through application of the following tools: \r\n1) Collaboration: Convening diverse (often opposing) interests to share knowledge, reach agreement, and implement on-the-ground projects that achieve ecosystem restoration, stewardship and community development goals.\r\n2) Stewardship: Assisting communities to develop new strategies for restoring landscape and ecosystem health while maintaining and strengthening the local natural resource economy.\r\n3) Market Solutions: Stimulating markets for products that promote environmental restoration and stewardship, and the retention and creation of jobs.  \r\n4) Policy: Translating local challenges and lessons learned about collaborative conservation into policy reform at the state, regional and national levels through leadership development, research and education, and regional organizing.\r\n5) Sustainable Finance: Exploring, developing, and advocating for new and innovative approaches to increasing philanthropic and commercial or capital investment in rural community sustainability. \r\n6) Education: Disseminating sustainability strategies and success stories to the broader Pacific Northwest community through publications, events, regional and local forums, and the media. \r\n\r\nThrough this work, Sustainable Northwest has developed a track record as a regional non-profit that catalyzes and energizes partnerships at the local level and fosters productive collaboration and access to resources, technical, financial, and political, at the regional and national levels."

The store is open 40 hours a week; consistently grosses $30,000 a monthly; builds community; and  provides volunteer experiences as a \"Community Center in Action!\"  Last year volunteers contributed over 30,000 volunteer hours and helped divert 700 tons of reusable donations from the local landfill."

We strive to make theater that lives on in our audience’s minds long after the actors take their bows.\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1988 as an northern offshoot of Ashland’s Oregon Shakespeare Festival, PCS became an independent theater in 1994 and has been under the creative leadership of Artistic Director Chris Coleman since May 2000. We produce an annual season of 11-12 plays that present diverse voices, perspectives, and theatrical experiences – from enduring classics to world premieres by emerging talents. PCS is deeply invested in nurturing new work, particularly through our annual JAW (Just Add Water): A Playwrights Festival; to date, 62 plays commissioned or developed at PCS have gone on to be produced at more than 150 professional theaters throughout North America and the U.K. Since 2002, we have premiered 23 plays on our own stages, including Dan O’Brien’s multi-award-winning \"The Body of an American,\" Yussef El Guindi’s \"Threesome,\" and Part One of Chris Coleman’s epic, \"Astoria.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to investing in our creative work, PCS is dedicated to fostering community connection, engaging young people, and nurturing future arts audiences through a wide array of education and community programs. Since moving into The Armory in 2006, our goal has been to make our home an active and welcoming space for all. Each year we partner with more than 150 artists and organizations, such as Central City Concern, Theater Diaspora, Oregon Humanities, Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center, Partners in Diversity, Stumptown Speakers Series, and the YWCA. In 2016/17, more than 20,000 people participated in programs like our “Performance Perspectives” conversation series, Community Artist Labs, pre-show Happy Hours, visual arts exhibits, and First Thursday music concerts, to name a few. Nearly 8,000 young people participated in our arts learning programs for youth, which include free in-school residencies in playwriting and theater fundamentals, Stage Door performances and workshops, Summer Teen Intensives, and the PCS Teen Council, as well as internship and job shadowing opportunities.\r\n\r\nOverall, PCS now serves more than 150,000 people annually and employs more than 450 artists, artisans, production personnel, staff, and contractors."
