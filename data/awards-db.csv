CRITFC’s mission is “to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources, and as managers, to protect reserved treaty rights through the exercise of the inherent sovereign powers of the tribes.”

This mission is accomplished with four primary goals:

1. Put Fish Back in the Rivers and Protect Watersheds Where Fish Live

CRITFC provides our four member tribes and the region with invaluable biological research, fisheries management, hydrology, and other science to support the protection and restoration of Columbia River Basin salmon, lamprey, and sturgeon. The vision of this goal is to reverse the decline of salmon, lamprey, and sturgeon and rebuild their numbers to full productivity. This work is guided by the holistic principles outlined in Wy-Kan-Ush-Mi Wa-Kish-Wit (Spirit of the Salmon), the tribal salmon plan that addresses recommended restoration actions in every phase of the salmon’s lifecycle from stream to ocean and back.

2. Protect Tribal Treaty Fishing Rights

CRITFC employs lawyers, policy analysts, and fisheries enforcement officers who work to ensure that tribal treaty rights are protected. All of these activities are done in careful coordination with and under the direction of member tribes. The commission works closely with state and federal agencies to ensure fair harvest sharing between tribal and non-tribal fisheries.

3. Share Salmon Culture

CRITFC shares news, information, and the tribal perspective on a variety of issues. Common topics include salmon and lamprey restoration, the nature of treaty fishing rights, and tribal culture. This effort ranges from school children to policy makers. By educating the general public on these topics, the tribes hope to increase interest for productive partnerships and support in the effort to restore Columbia River Basin salmon and lamprey.

4. Provide Fisher Services

CRITFC provides a variety of services directly to fishers from its member tribes. The Salmon Marketing program provides fishers from the four member tribes with resources to help them carry on the tradition of making a living from fishing, whether that be from commercial, over-the-bank, or value-added fish sales. The organization also operates and maintains 31 fishing access sites along the Columbia River for the exclusive or near-exclusive use of the fishers from all the member tribes."

In 1996, representatives from Environmental Defense, local irrigation districts and the Confederated Tribes of Warms Springs came together and founded the DRC - the first non-profit corporation to bring together State, Federal, Tribal and local government representatives as well as private stakeholders to carry out comprehensive, basin-wide ecosystem restoration.  The DRC's mission is to restore stream flow and improve water quality throughout the Deschutes Basin.

The DRC restores stream flow through a combination of temporary and permanant solutions.  A temporary streamflow restoration tool, the DRC's Annual Water Leasing Program (AWLP), has grown from a small, donation-based campaign to an eight-district, paid program comprising the largest portion of protected water in the Deschutes River.  In 2005, the leasing program delivered the largest amount of ecologically significant flows to the Deschutes Basin.  AWLP was responsible for more than doubling the average summer flow in the Middle Deschutes, contributing 89 cubic feet per second (CFS) instream.  The Annual Water Leasing Program allows holders of water rights to lease their unused water rights instream on a temporary basis.  This market-based approach provides benefits to all who participate in the program, and is indicative of the DRC's innovative, collaborative approach to conservation.

In addition to the AWLP, the DRC works, in collaboration with local municipalities and irrigation districts, to devise and implement engineering-based approaches to conservation such as replacing or lining leaky irrigation canals and lateral diversions.  These projects are designed to address the fact that 50% of all water diverted from instream flow for irrigation purposes is lost as a result of seepage from irrigation ditches and canals.  By repairing and/or replacing leaky conduits, the DRC and its partners can conserve water that would otherwise be lost, which can then be diverted instream or held in reserve for other uses."

Prevention and strengthening families are core philosophies promoting children's healthy physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development.  Our core programs are:
1- Therapeutic Early Childhood Program (TECP):   Site-based program for children aged from birth to six years, providing twice weekly classroom sessions in a developmentally appropriate early childhood environment, mental health assessments and counseling, special education assessments and services, home visits, parenting education and support, and family advocacy.
2- Home Base:  Intensive home visiting version of the TECP, designed for rural or otherwise isolated families.  Provides one home visit and one site-based TECP classday each week, as well as all other services described above. 
3- Families Together:  An intensive parent training program for parents who have lost their children to foster care or are at risk of doing so.  Provides weekly interactive parent/child labs and parent training classes, mental health assessments and counseling referrals, special education assessments and referrals, home visits, counseling referrals, and family advocacy.
4- Accessing Success:  Family-centered substance abuse recovery support program, integrated with all other programs.  Provides drug and alcohol assessment, counseling, anger management classes, peer support, childcare, transportation, and social skill activities to help parents achieve and maintain recovery.
5- Outreach Connection:  For families requiring immediate intervention, or on our waiting list to enter other programs. Provides individualized, immediate-response crisis intervention, home visits, respite, developmental screenings, safety monitoring, parent training, and referrals.
6- Healthy Start:  Collaboration between Relief Nursery and Healthy Start of Lane County.  Provides Nursery services, parenting education, and support to highest-risk first-birth parents; families are referred to the program, and services begin, before the birth of the child.
7- Community Safety Net:   Collaboration with DHS Child Welfare  and other community agencies, designed to reach families with reports of suspected abuse or neglect made to DHS, but in which the level of abuse/neglect has not reached sufficient levels to trigger a full-scale DHS investigation.  Catches children who might otherwise ""fall through the cracks"" of conventional child protective services.

Families we serve are among the highest risk:  all have at least 5 major risk factors correlated with child abuse and neglect, and 55% have ten or more of these risk factors.  Our population's most common risks are:  extreme low income (100%); poverty and unemployment (70-80%); high stress (65%);  substance abuse (55-70%); single parent household (50%); domestic violence (46%); history with Child Protective Services (45-60%);  and involvement with the criminal justice system (40%).  Other serious risk factors (affecting 25-35% of our population) include:  adult survivor of child abuse; battered spouse; limited education; child foster care history; mental illness; teen parent; and lack of basic support services (housing; transportation; telephone, etc.)

The Relief Nursery has a highly successful 30-year record of  working with these severely-challenged families.  After one year of Relief Nursery services fewer than 7% of  the children require further reports of child abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to DHS (our staff are mandatory reporters).  Fewer than 1% of our children need to be placed in foster care, and 100% of our children are either making appropriate developmental progress or are receiving appropriate special needs services.

This record of success has inspired many other communities in Oregon to request Relief Nurseries for their communities, and we have formal replication sites in Cottage Grove; Salem'; Portland (2 sites); Roseburg; Bend; and Albany.  Other communites are currently exploring the replication process as well, and we have received national and even international recognition for our program model.

In the past fiscal year we served 603 families in site- and home-based therapeutic programs, 147 families through our community outreach program, and an additional 194 families via the Reliefmobile -- a total of 1075 children.  Our minority population is high -- about 22%, with Hispanic families making up the largest subgroup.  For the past several years we have been providing bilingual and bicultural services in all programs, and have initiated special ESL/parenting groups for interested families.

2) Stewardship: Assisting communities to develop new strategies for restoring landscape and ecosystem health while maintaining and strengthening the local natural resource economy.
3) Market Solutions: Stimulating markets for products that promote environmental restoration and stewardship, and the retention and creation of jobs.  
4) Policy: Translating local challenges and lessons learned about collaborative conservation into policy reform at the state, regional and national levels through leadership development, research and education, and regional organizing.
5) Sustainable Finance: Exploring, developing, and advocating for new and innovative approaches to increasing philanthropic and commercial or capital investment in rural community sustainability.

Portland Center Stage at The Armory (PCS) is on a mission to inspire our community by bringing stories to life in unexpected ways. Whether presenting a fresh take on a vintage musical or championing the premiere of a new play, we aim to tell stories that resonate with our times.  Each performance is an opportunity to spark imaginations, wrestle with our own humanity, and foster an expanded sense of community. We strive to make theater that lives on in our audience’s minds long after the actors take their bows.

Established in 1988 as an northern offshoot of Ashland’s Oregon Shakespeare Festival, PCS became an independent theater in 1994 and has been under the creative leadership of Artistic Director Chris Coleman since May 2000. We produce an annual season of 11-12 plays that present diverse voices, perspectives, and theatrical experiences – from enduring classics to world premieres by emerging talents. PCS is deeply invested in nurturing new work, particularly through our annual JAW (Just Add Water): A Playwrights Festival; to date, 62 plays commissioned or developed at PCS have gone on to be produced at more than 150 professional theaters throughout North America and the U.K. Since 2002, we have premiered 23 plays on our own stages, including Dan O’Brien’s multi-award-winning ""The Body of an American,"" Yussef El Guindi’s ""Threesome,"" and Part One of Chris Coleman’s epic, ""Astoria.""

In addition to investing in our creative work, PCS is dedicated to fostering community connection, engaging young people, and nurturing future arts audiences through a wide array of education and community programs. Since moving into The Armory in 2006, our goal has been to make our home an active and welcoming space for all. Each year we partner with more than 150 artists and organizations, such as Central City Concern, Theater Diaspora, Oregon Humanities, Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center, Partners in Diversity, Stumptown Speakers Series, and the YWCA. In 2016/17, more than 20,000 people participated in programs like our “Performance Perspectives” conversation series, Community Artist Labs, pre-show Happy Hours, visual arts exhibits, and First Thursday music concerts, to name a few. Nearly 8,000 young people participated in our arts learning programs for youth, which include free in-school residencies in playwriting and theater fundamentals, Stage Door performances and workshops, Summer Teen Intensives, and the PCS Teen Council, as well as internship and job shadowing opportunities.

Overall, PCS now serves more than 150,000 people annually and employs more than 450 artists, artisans, production personnel, staff, and contractors."
